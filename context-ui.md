# UI Components Context

This document contains detailed information about the UI component library of the Supply Chain System project. For a high-level overview of the entire project, see [main context](./context.md).

## Overview

The UI component library provides a consistent set of reusable components for the Supply Chain System frontend. It is built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Architecture

- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Documentation**: Storybook
- **Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library
- **Package**: Published as `@supply-chain-system/ui`

## Recent Changes

- Implemented core UI component library:
  - Created base components (Button, Input, Select, etc.)
  - Added form components with validation
  - Implemented data display components (Table, Card, etc.)
  - Added navigation components (Tabs, Breadcrumbs, etc.)
- Enhanced component styling:
  - Implemented consistent design tokens
  - Added dark mode support
  - Ensured accessibility compliance
  - Created responsive variants
- Improved component documentation:
  - Added Storybook stories for all components
  - Included usage examples and prop documentation
  - Added accessibility guidelines

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <FormField label="Name">
      <Input placeholder="Enter your name" />
      <Button>Submit</Button>
    </FormField>
  );
}
```

## Known Issues

- Need to improve mobile responsiveness for some components
- Need to add more comprehensive keyboard navigation
- Some components need better accessibility support
- Need to add more comprehensive unit tests
- Need to optimize bundle size for larger components

## Next Steps

- Improve animation and transition effects
- Add more comprehensive documentation
