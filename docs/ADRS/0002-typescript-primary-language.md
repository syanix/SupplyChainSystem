# ADR 0002: TypeScript as Primary Language

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to select a primary programming language for the Supply Chain Management System that provides strong typing, good tooling support, and is suitable for both frontend and backend development.

## Decision

We will use TypeScript as the primary programming language for all components of the Supply Chain Management System, including:

- Frontend (Next.js application)
- Backend (NestJS API)
- Shared libraries and utilities
- Database access layer

## Rationale

- **Static Typing**: TypeScript's static type system helps catch errors during development rather than at runtime
- **Developer Experience**: Improved code completion, refactoring, and navigation in IDEs
- **Code Quality**: Types serve as documentation and enforce consistent interfaces between components
- **Ecosystem Compatibility**: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, allowing use of the entire JavaScript ecosystem
- **Full-Stack Consistency**: Using the same language across frontend and backend reduces context switching
- **Enterprise Readiness**: TypeScript is well-suited for large-scale applications with multiple developers
- **Framework Support**: Both Next.js and NestJS have first-class TypeScript support

## Alternatives Considered

### JavaScript

- **Pros**: No compilation step, wider developer familiarity, no type overhead
- **Cons**: Lack of static typing, more runtime errors, reduced IDE support, less self-documenting code

### Go (for Backend)

- **Pros**: Performance, strong typing, good concurrency model
- **Cons**: Different language for frontend and backend, smaller ecosystem for web development

### Python (for Backend)

- **Pros**: Easy to learn, extensive libraries, good for data processing
- **Cons**: Dynamic typing, performance limitations, different language for frontend and backend

## Implementation

- Configure TypeScript compiler options in `tsconfig.json` files for each package
- Set up strict type checking to maximize benefits
- Use ESLint with TypeScript-specific rules
- Implement shared types in the `shared` package for cross-package type safety

## Consequences

### Positive

- Fewer runtime errors due to type checking
- Better developer tooling and IDE support
- Improved code maintainability and refactorability
- Self-documenting code through type definitions
- Consistent language across all parts of the system

### Negative

- Additional build step for compilation
- Learning curve for developers not familiar with TypeScript
- Type declaration overhead
- Potential challenges with some third-party libraries lacking type definitions

## Related Decisions

- ADR 0001: Monorepo Structure
- ADR 0003: Next.js for Frontend Application
- ADR 0004: NestJS for Backend API

## Notes

We will maintain a balance between strict typing and pragmatic development. In cases where typing becomes overly complex or hinders development speed, we may selectively use type assertions or less strict typing approaches.
