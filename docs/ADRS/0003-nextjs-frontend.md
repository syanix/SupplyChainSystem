# ADR 0003: Next.js for Frontend Application

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to select a frontend framework for the Supply Chain Management System that provides a good developer experience, performance, and SEO capabilities. The framework should support modern web development practices and integrate well with our chosen technology stack.

## Decision

We will use Next.js as the frontend framework for the Supply Chain Management System web application.

## Rationale

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Next.js provides built-in SSR capabilities, improving initial load performance and SEO
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Ability to pre-render pages at build time for even better performance
- **API Routes**: Built-in API route support simplifies backend integration
- **TypeScript Support**: First-class TypeScript support aligns with our primary language choice
- **File-Based Routing**: Intuitive routing system based on file structure
- **Component Reusability**: React-based component model promotes reusable UI elements
- **Developer Experience**: Hot module replacement, fast refresh, and excellent error reporting
- **Built-in Optimizations**: Automatic image optimization, code splitting, and bundle optimization
- **Incremental Adoption**: Can be gradually adopted and integrated with existing systems
- **Enterprise Adoption**: Widely used in enterprise applications with proven scalability

## Alternatives Considered

### Create React App (CRA)

- **Pros**: Simpler setup, familiar to many React developers
- **Cons**: No built-in SSR, requires additional configuration for SEO, less optimized for production

### Vue.js / Nuxt.js

- **Pros**: Good performance, simpler learning curve
- **Cons**: Smaller ecosystem, less TypeScript integration, team more familiar with React

### Angular

- **Pros**: Comprehensive framework, strong enterprise support
- **Cons**: Steeper learning curve, heavier bundle size, less flexibility

## Implementation

- Set up Next.js with TypeScript configuration
- Implement Tailwind CSS for styling
- Configure authentication with NextAuth.js
- Set up API route proxying to the NestJS backend
- Implement shared UI components in the UI package

## Consequences

### Positive

- Improved SEO capabilities through server-side rendering
- Better performance through built-in optimizations
- Enhanced developer experience with hot reloading and intuitive routing
- Simplified deployment with static generation options
- Strong TypeScript integration

### Negative

- Learning curve for developers not familiar with Next.js
- More complex build and deployment process compared to client-only SPAs
- Potential hydration issues when mixing server and client components

## Related Decisions

- ADR 0001: Monorepo Structure
- ADR 0002: TypeScript as Primary Language
- ADR 0004: NestJS for Backend API

## Notes

We will continuously evaluate the performance and developer experience of Next.js as the application grows. If we encounter significant issues with the framework, we may revisit this decision.
