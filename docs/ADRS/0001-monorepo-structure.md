# ADR 0001: Monorepo Structure for Supply Chain Management System

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to determine the most effective project structure for the Supply Chain Management System that allows for code sharing, maintainability, and scalability. The system consists of multiple applications (web frontend, API backend) and shared libraries.

## Decision

We will use a monorepo structure with npm workspaces to organize our codebase. The structure will be:

```
SupplyChainSystem/
├── apps/
│   ├── api/       # NestJS backend API
│   └── web/       # Next.js frontend application
├── packages/
│   ├── database/  # Database models and migrations
│   ├── shared/    # Shared utilities and types
│   └── ui/        # Shared UI component library
└── docs/          # Project documentation
```

## Rationale

- **Code Sharing**: A monorepo allows us to share code between applications easily through internal packages
- **Consistent Tooling**: All projects can use the same linting, formatting, and testing configurations
- **Atomic Changes**: Changes that span multiple packages can be committed together
- **Simplified Dependency Management**: Dependencies can be hoisted to the root, reducing duplication
- **Coordinated Versioning**: Easier to maintain compatible versions across packages
- **Streamlined CI/CD**: Build and test processes can be optimized for the entire codebase

## Alternatives Considered

### Multiple Repositories

- **Pros**: Clear boundaries, independent versioning, smaller repositories
- **Cons**: Difficult code sharing, complex dependency management, challenging to make cross-cutting changes

### Monolith Application

- **Pros**: Simplicity, no need for package management
- **Cons**: Poor separation of concerns, difficult to scale development across teams, potential for large codebase with unclear boundaries

## Implementation

- Use npm workspaces for package management
- Configure Turbo for task running and build optimization
- Set up shared ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Implement TypeScript project references for type checking across packages

## Consequences

### Positive

- Simplified development workflow
- Easier code sharing and reuse
- Consistent tooling and standards across the codebase
- Improved developer experience with single repository checkout

### Negative

- Potential for larger repository size over time
- Learning curve for developers not familiar with monorepo structures
- Need for more sophisticated build and CI/CD pipelines

## Related Decisions

- ADR 0002: TypeScript as Primary Language
- ADR 0003: Next.js for Frontend Application
- ADR 0004: NestJS for Backend API

## Notes

We will revisit this decision if the repository size becomes unmanageable or if we encounter significant performance issues with the monorepo approach.
