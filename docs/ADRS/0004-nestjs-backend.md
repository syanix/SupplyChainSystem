# ADR 0004: NestJS for Backend API

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to select a backend framework for the Supply Chain Management System that provides a structured architecture, good TypeScript support, and enterprise-grade features. The framework should facilitate building a scalable, maintainable API that integrates well with our chosen technology stack.

## Decision

We will use NestJS as the backend framework for the Supply Chain Management System API.

## Rationale

- **TypeScript-First**: Built with and fully supports TypeScript, aligning with our primary language choice
- **Modular Architecture**: Promotes organization of code into modules for better maintainability
- **Dependency Injection**: Built-in DI container simplifies testing and promotes loose coupling
- **Decorators & Metadata**: Leverages TypeScript decorators for clean, declarative code
- **Express/Fastify Integration**: Built on top of proven Node.js HTTP frameworks
- **OpenAPI Integration**: First-class support for Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- **Middleware Support**: Robust middleware system for cross-cutting concerns
- **Microservices Ready**: Built-in support for microservices architecture if needed in the future
- **Active Community**: Well-maintained with regular updates and extensive documentation
- **Enterprise Adoption**: Used by many large companies for production applications

## Alternatives Considered

### Express.js

- **Pros**: Lightweight, flexible, widely adopted
- **Cons**: Minimal structure, requires additional libraries for many features, less TypeScript integration

### Koa.js

- **Pros**: Modern middleware approach, lightweight
- **Cons**: Less structured, smaller ecosystem, requires more configuration

### Fastify

- **Pros**: Performance-focused, schema validation
- **Cons**: Smaller ecosystem, less opinionated structure

### Hapi.js

- **Pros**: Configuration-centric, built-in validation
- **Cons**: Steeper learning curve, less TypeScript integration

## Implementation

- Set up NestJS with TypeScript configuration
- Implement modular architecture based on domain concepts
- Configure TypeORM for database interactions
- Set up Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- Implement JWT authentication with Supabase integration
- Configure validation using class-validator

## Consequences

### Positive

- Structured, consistent codebase
- Improved maintainability through modularity
- Better testability through dependency injection
- Automatic API documentation
- Strong TypeScript integration

### Negative

- Steeper learning curve for developers not familiar with NestJS
- More boilerplate code compared to minimal frameworks
- Potential performance overhead compared to bare-metal frameworks

## Related Decisions

- ADR 0001: Monorepo Structure
- ADR 0002: TypeScript as Primary Language
- ADR 0003: Next.js for Frontend Application

## Notes

We will continuously evaluate the performance and developer experience of NestJS as the application grows. If we encounter significant issues with the framework, we may revisit this decision.
